            The curatorial team led the conceptual direction of the exhibit, wrote the curatorial statement, designed the spatial layout, worked with gallery staff to install the works, and communicated with past and present graduate students to select works.
            <br><br>
            The concept, For Reference Only, was an invitation to viewers to pause and engage the works beyond surface admiration. To facilitate this, we created both a wall of monitors to view websites and a reading room with chairs for visitors to literally sit with the works. I was heavily involved in the drafting and revision of the curatorial statement, as well as the spatial layout/concept and installation of the exhibit.
