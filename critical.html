            <span class="title">Critical Zine</span><br><br>
            2023<br><br>
            Critical maps out various perspectives on the role of critical practices, agency, and change within the graphic design industry. The 6 sections are ordered along a spectrum, summarizing the arguments and outlooks of various authors, designers, and studios. The zine begins by exploring the outlook of critical designers, who believe that individual designers can better the industry (and world) through cultural change and inclusive practices. It ends by looking at the perspective of designers critical of the design industry, who advocate for economic change, freedom from the industry, and organized labor over cultural change or individual practices. It also offers perspective in between, such as Angela Davis’s Mandate for a People’s Culture, in which she advocates for the production of radical culture in tandem with political movements and organization.
