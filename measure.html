            2024<br><br>
            10 double-sided plates interpreting and responding to "Instruction on Measurement" by Albrecht Durer, written in 1528. The red band surrounding the plates functions as a container, a measuring device, and includes instructions on how to arrange the plates on both sides. When arranged on side 1, which reads “To Measure is to Know”, the plates contain an interpretation of the book through Aristotle’s 10 categories. When flipped over and rearranged, Side 2, which reads “To Measure is to Rationalize / To Rationalize is to Control”, reveals a 1:1 scale of my body. I meiculously labeled a photo of myself, part-to-part, and documented within the key. It considers some modern developments of the rationalization of the body from the emergence of a burgeoning capitalist, mechanical philosophy of the body in the 1600s to facial recognition technology today.
